### Design Choices
* Overview

   As this site is for a Pod campsite in a rural location the colour scheme and visuals have been chosen to reflect a more narual palette, keeping a more rustic aesthetic.  

* Fonts

   To choose the appropriate fints for this project I visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and browsed the various fonts available.
   for the main content of the page I chose [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/?sort=popularity&preview.text=Wild%20Getaway!&preview.text_type=custom&sidebar.open=true&selection.family=Amatic+SC:wght@400;700&query=lato)
   as it is a clear and easy to read font, making the page easily accessible for users. I chose [Amatic SC](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Amatic+SC?sort=popularity&category=Handwriting&preview.text=Wild%20Getaway!&preview.text_type=custom&sidebar.open=true&selection.family=Amatic+SC:wght@400;700)
   for the titles and subtitles as it is a handwriting style font to give the page a more natural feel and to add a more personal touch.   

* Icons

   I used icons from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome") the icons I chose are inline with the over all feel for the site and are gneral industry standard.
   The icons have been selected so as not to stand out from the site but to add to the overall eas of use for the user enabling intuitve navigation.
   
* Colors

   The color scheme has been chosen to reflect the natural environment that the Pod campsite is situated in, the chosen colors can be view below.   
   Below I will explain why each color was chosen and what they will be used for.   

![Color Palette](wireframes/color_scheme.png)

  * #364958 will be used for the header and footer elements this charcoal color has been chosen to represent the night sky as the Pod site is situated within an international dark sky reserve.
  * #3B6064 will be used as the main back ground color for the website. This dark teal color has been chosen to represent the forests that are local to the holiday site.
  * #87BBA2 will be used for the call to action buttons on the website as well as the contact form, this light green tone has been selected for its closenesss to the mpprland grasses in the local landscape.
  * #C9E4CA text color
  * #55828B additional background color

* Structure

### Wireframes

   I decided to use [Balamiq Wrieframes](https://balsamiq.com/) to create my wireframes, starting with a basic wireframe for the desktop, them moved 
   on to the tablet and mobile wireframes, to get and idea of how I wanted the layout to work at different media points. I decided to utilise a one page
   sebsite for this project as this is widely used in the tourism industry for ease of use for the user. The website will also use a navigation bar to
   make quick access available for users looking for particular information rather than having to scroll every time.

   Wireframes can be view on the following links:
